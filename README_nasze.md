# ITU SDSE Project – ML Pipeline with Dagger & GitHub Actions

## Project Overview
This project implements a **machine learning pipeline** to identify **new possible customers** on a website.  
It uses **user behavior data** as input, and the target is whether the user converted into a customer (classification problem).

The ML pipeline handles **data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training and evaluation, model selection and deployment**.  
The original notebook has been refactored into **Python scripts**, and the pipeline is containerized with **Dagger** and automated via **GitHub Actions** for reproducibility.

> Note: The starting notebook may contain extra comments, markdown, and unused code. The goal is to refactor it into clean Python scripts while keeping functionality identical.
